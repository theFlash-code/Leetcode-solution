## Programming Language
I'm currently using Java as my main programming language on leetcode.
## My story with Leetcode
I start to solve problem on leetcode since 2020 Jan, but back then I barely know anything about Data Structure & Algorithm. With the help of youtube videos and resources online, I slowly improved my skills. Now I'm enjoying coding more than ever ^.^<br>
Two years after, I decided to upload my leetcode solution on github.
